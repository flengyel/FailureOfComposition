# Codes acting on an encoded list

A list of natural numbers is represented by its `Encodable` code, in which the
empty list is `0` and a cons cell is the successor of a Cantor pair of head and
tail.  `codeListHead?` and `codeListTail` invert that representation, and
`codeListDrop` iterates the tail by primitive recursion, so that
`codeListGet?` reads the entry at an index as an encoded `Option`.  `codeListLength`
minimizes the number of entries that must be dropped to reach the empty list, and
`codeOptionBind` is the bind of the encoded option monad.

Only the code constructions are given here.  The standard computation theorems
over the natural numbers are not part of this migration.

/-! ### One-layer view of an encoded list

The pinned encoding of `List ℕ` satisfies `encode [] = 0` and
`encode (x :: xs) = Nat.pair x (encode xs) + 1`.  The two constructors below
name that layer as codes; no arithmetic property of the encoding is asserted
here. -/
